# atmegaPiano
The piano has 10 contact switches that are used as piano keys, two buttons, an LCD screen, and its brightness knob. The buttons allow you to switch octaves in order to get
more sounds out of the limited 10 keys.
The LCD will indicate which musical note you are pressing as well as its current octave.
